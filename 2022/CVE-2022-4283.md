### Description

A vulnerability was found in X.Org. This issue occurs because the XkbCopyNames function leaves a dangling pointer to freed memory, resulting in out-of-bounds memory access on subsequent XkbGetKbdByName requests. This flaw can lead to local privilege elevation on systems where the X server runs privileged and remote code execution for ssh X forwarding sessions.
