### Description

A vulnerability was found in X.Org. The issue occurs because the handler for the XIChangeProperty request has a length-validation issue, resulting in out-of-bounds memory reads and potential information disclosure. This flaw can lead to local privilege elevation on systems where the X server runs privileged and remote code execution for ssh X forwarding sessions.
