### Description

It was discovered that NetworkManager would set device MTUs based on MTU values received in IPv6 RAs (Router Advertisements), without sanity checking the MTU value first. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to create a denial of service attack, by sending a specially crafted IPv6 RA packet to disturb IPv6 communication.
