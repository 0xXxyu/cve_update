### Description

It was discovered that some items in the S3Token paste configuration as used by python-keystonemiddleware (formerly python-keystoneclient) were incorrectly evaluated as strings, an issue similar to CVE-2014-7144. If the "insecure" option were set to "false", the option would be evaluated as true, resulting in TLS connections being vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks. Note: the "insecure" option defaults to false, so setups that do not specifically define "insecure=false" are not affected.
