### Description

It was found that SSSD's Privilege Attribute Certificate (PAC) responder plug-in would leak a small amount of memory on each authentication request. A remote attacker could potentially use this flaw to exhaust all available memory on the system by making repeated requests to a Kerberized daemon application configured to authenticate using the PAC responder plug-in.
