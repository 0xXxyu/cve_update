### Description

A null pointer dereference issue was discovered in Libtiff's tif_dir.c file. This flaw allows an attacker to pass a crafted TIFF image file to the tiffcp utility, which triggers runtime error, causing an undefined behavior, resulting in an application crash, eventually leading to a denial of service.
