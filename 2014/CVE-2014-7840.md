### Description

It was found that certain values that were read when loading RAM during migration were not validated. A user able to alter the savevm data (either on the disk or over the wire during migration) could use either of these flaws to corrupt QEMU process memory on the (destination) host, which could potentially result in arbitrary code execution on the host with the privileges of the QEMU process.
