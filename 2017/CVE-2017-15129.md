### Description

A use-after-free vulnerability was found in a network namespaces code affecting the Linux kernel since v4.0-rc1 through v4.15-rc5. The function get_net_ns_by_id() does not check for the net::count value after it has found a peer network in netns_ids idr which could lead to double free and memory corruption. This vulnerability could allow an unprivileged local user to induce kernel memory corruption on the system, leading to a crash. Due to the nature of the flaw, privilege escalation cannot be fully ruled out, although it is thought to be unlikely.
