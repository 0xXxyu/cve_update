### Description

The Linux kernel is vulnerable to an out-of-bound access bug in the fs/posix_acl.c:get_acl() function. An attacker could trick a legitimate user or a privileged attacker could exploit this to cause a system crash or other unspecified impact with a crafted ext4 image. Due to the nature of the flaw, privilege escalation cannot be fully ruled out, although we believe it is unlikely.
